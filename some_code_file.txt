Here is a simple dummy text file.
It has a few lines of code.


print('Hello World')

x = 10
y = 20
z = x + y


def sum_two_digits(first_digit = 0, second_digit = 0):
    sum_two = first_digit + second_digit)
    return sum_two

# for instructors only (delete this from file version for students)
# add the following function

def def sum_two_digits(first_digit = 0, second_digit = 0, third_digit = 0):
    sum_three = first_digit + second_digit = third_digit)
    return sum_three
